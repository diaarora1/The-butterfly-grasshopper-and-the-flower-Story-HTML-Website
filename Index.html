    <img src="a1.jpg" id="pic1">
    <p id="story">In a meadow between rolling hills,  lived a grasshopper named Max. He was a vibrant green,
         with long. Max spent his days in the warm sunlight, hopping from one blade of grass to another.

        Nearby, a delicate flower named Rose swayed gracefully in the breeze. She was covered with 
        petals, painted in pink and blue, with a sweet fragrance. Rose's roots burrowed deep into the rich soil.
        
        One sunny morning, as Max leaped through the meadow, his path crossed with that of Rose's. 
        Entranced by her beauty, he paused gazed at her in awe. Rose unfurled her petals, revealing 
        her radiant colors.
        
        "Hello there, little grasshopper," Rose greeted with a gentle rustle of her petals.
        
        Max, slightly taken aback by her greeting, replied, "Oh, hello, Rose! I've never seen 
        a flower as lovely as you."
        
        A warm blush spread across Rose's petals as she thanked him, and thus began an unlikely 
        friendship between the grasshopper and the flower.
        
        As days turned into weeks, Max and Rose shared stories of their respective worlds—the adventures Max 
        had while hopping through the meadow and the many things  Rose witnessed as she swayed in the breeze.
         They laughed together and sang songs. 
        
        One day, as Max and Rose  were lost in conversation, a butterfly named Lucy full of colors fluttered by.
         Her wings, adorned with intricate patterns, shimmered in the sunlight as she moved effortlessly through
         the air.
        <br>
        Intrigued by the newcomer, Max and Rose watched in awe as Lucy landed gracefully on a nearby flower.
        
        "Hello, beautiful creatures," Lacy greeted with a flutter of her wings. "What brings you both together today?"
        
        Max and Rose exchanged a glance before inviting Lucy to join them. And so, under the warm glow of 
        the sun, the grasshopper, the flower, and the butterfly spent the day sharing stories, laughter, 
        and friendship.
        
        As the day drew to a close and the sun dipped into the horizon,  Max, Rose, and Lucy bid
         each other farewell, knowing that their unlikely bond would hold them together in the meadow.
